This project is covered in Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct is modified from ![MediaWiki Code of Conduct](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct)

# Principles
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we are committed to making participation in Wikimedia technical projects a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, disability, neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, political affiliation, or religion.

Technical skills and community status make no difference to the right to be respected and the obligation to respect others. Newcomers and other contributors with limited experience in our community deserve a welcoming attitude and constructive feedback. Prolific contributions and technical expertise are not a justification for lower standards of behaviour.

# Unacceptable behaviour
Harassment and other types of inappropriate behaviour are unacceptable in all public and private Wikimedia technical spaces. Examples include but are not limited to:

* Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, threats of legal action, or deliberate intimidation.
* Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.
* Gratuitous or off-topic use of sexual language or imagery.
* Inappropriate or unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact (sexual or otherwise).
* Inappropriate or unwanted public or private communication, following, or any form of stalking.
* Unwanted photography or recording.
* Disclosure of a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not consent to disclose other identifying information.
* Inappropriate or unwanted publication of private communication. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying information for the purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) and/or in the case of whistleblowing, is acceptable.
* Harming the discussion or community with methods such as sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration (i.e. trolling).
* Discrimination, particularly against marginalised and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.
* Using the code of conduct system for purposes other than reporting genuine violations of the code of conduct (e.g., retaliating against a reporter or victim by filing a report claiming their response was harassment).

# Report a problem
***In case of threats of harm and other urgent situations****, notify the relevant authorities first (if possible) and email the owner of this project (lesboyspp43@outlook.com).*

People who experience or observe unacceptable behaviour are encouraged to follow any of these steps:

1. Ask the person who is behaving unacceptably to stop. Make them aware of this Code of Conduct.
2. If you are at an event, report the problem to the event organisers, or a designated contact.
3. Report the problem by GitHub issue with `CoC Violation` label.

Reports can be as short as a notification with a link, but more information will help us understand what is happening. You can include:
* Your contact information (GitHub username, E-mail address and Wikimedia Phabricator username, etc.)
* Your account of the incident:
** Where and when it happened.
** A description of the unacceptable behaviour.
** Who was involved and who saw it happen.
** Whether the incident is ongoing.
* Any additional information that will help us fully understand the problem, such as previous incidents or special circumstances.
* Links to public records of the incident, if any.
* Screenshots showing what exactly happened.
